        <p>
            Awhile back, I saw a YouTube video titled “Coding Adventure: Marching Cubes” by Sebastian Lague. It was an
            exploration of a graphical algorithm which generates a mesh (shape) based of 8-point fields (cubes). For
            those curious, the video goes in-depth about how the algorithm generates the mesh, but essentially:
        </p>
        <ol className="style-list">
            <li>Take 8 equidistant points, forming a cube.</li>
            <li>Assign a numeric value to the points, based on a formula of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Compare the numeric values to a constant, called the “isolevel”.</li>
            <li>Create a new byte, set it to 0.</li>
            <li>Go through the points, and if the point’s value is above the isolevel, set the appropriate bit in the
                byte to 1. For example, if point 1’s value is 25, and the isolevel is 10, then the byte is now 0000
                0001.</li>
            <li>As such, the byte creates a number between 0 and 255.</li>
            <li>By inputting this number into a premade array of possible combinations, you get a shape made of
                triangles!</li>
            <li>You can use vertex interpolation to smooth out the shape.</li>
            <li>Finally, take these triangles and render them on the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If some of you are confused, that’s perfectly normal. My brain shutdown the first time I read the algorithm.
            Take your time on each step, and don’t be afraid to illustrate it on paper or whiteboard. Feel free to
            explore the demo on this page: it’s made to illustrate what is possible with marching cubes and a bit of
            tinkering with the formula.
            As a final note, if you are interested in implementing the algorithm, these are the sources I used:
